But once your dataset grows into millions of records, naive similarity search can bottleneck.\\n\\nI recently ran benchmarks on hybrid search (sparse + dense) over a 20M document dataset. Using approximate nearest neighbor indexing with metadata filters reduced query time from 2.8 seconds to 180ms.\\n\\nLesson: RAG is as much about *information architecture* as it is about prompt engineering. Treat your index like a core API — maintain it, monitor it, and optimize it relentlessly.'}]}]"
