# fine-tune-gpt-4

A Jupyter Notebook project demonstrating how to fine-tune GPT-4 using the OpenAI API.

## Overview

This project covers the end-to-end process of fine-tuning GPT-4, including:
- Environment setup and dependency installation
- Dataset preparation and formatting
- Uploading data and creating fine-tuning jobs
- Monitoring training
- Testing and using the fine-tuned model

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dinakajoy/fine-tune-gpt-4.git
   cd fine-tune-gpt-4

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dinakajoy/fine-tune-gpt-4.git
   cd fine-tune-gpt-4
3. **Set your OpenAI API key:** Check notebook
4. **Prepare your data**: Check the `LinkedIn Posts` folder.  
Save each fine-tuning data as a .txt file
5. Run the notebook
