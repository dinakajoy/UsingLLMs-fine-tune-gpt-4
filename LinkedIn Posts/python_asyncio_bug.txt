üêç When fixing a Python bug means rewriting asyncio itself‚Ä¶

"If nothing magically works, nothing magically breaks." ‚Äî that's my favourite quote in the world of software.

I recently encountered a super complex bug, and after countless hours of debugging and digging into the quirks of all the possible reference-holders of a certain object, actually modifying the *way Python's asyncio works* ended up being the best way to verify that its TimerHandles were the culprits (https://lnkd.in/gMme5QwK)

The "magic" Python does to abstract away a lot of programming from you is sometimes convenient, but this was a perfect example of how solving problems beyond a certain threshold of complexity is often *easier* with seemingly more "complex", less magical tooling ü™Ñ
