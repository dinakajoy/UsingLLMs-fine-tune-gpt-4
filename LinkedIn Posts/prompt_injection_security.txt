ðŸš¨ Prompt injection is the SQL injection of AI.

Iâ€™ve seen production systems fail catastrophically because a user slipped malicious instructions into model input.

Defenses Iâ€™ve implemented:
- Input sanitization
- Strict separation of user data & system prompts
- Post-processing validation

Never trust raw model output. Security in AI is still security.
