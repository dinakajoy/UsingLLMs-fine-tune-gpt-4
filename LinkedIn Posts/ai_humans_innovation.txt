ðŸ’¡ Will AI make us lazy â€” or spark more innovation?

It's a common fear that new technology â€” especially AI â€” could make humans lazier, less intelligent, and more dependent on tech.

But it's important to remember that humans have an innate imperative to apply their intelligence and creativity, even if that means they need to invent the outlet for that cognitive energy first!

In fact, that's what has historically led to a lot of innovation â€” technological progress has offloaded work from us, giving us not only the opportunity but the DESIRE to find new ways to apply our mental bandwidth.
