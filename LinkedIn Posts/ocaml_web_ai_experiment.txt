🐫 OCaml + AI: an underrated combo?

Most AI devs live in Python, but I wanted to see if OCaml could shine for AI-backed web apps. Using OCaml for the backend logic and a Python microservice for ML inference, I got:

- Type safety for complex data flows
- Predictable performance under high concurrency
- Easier reasoning about AI pipeline state

It’s niche, but if you’re into strongly-typed functional programming and need AI integration, OCaml can surprise you.
