📚 Why RAG might be the most important AI skill in 2025

If I had to bet on one skill in AI as an engineer… I’d go for RAG. And this is exactly how I’d learn it from scratch in 2025.

Why RAG?

When context windows are getting bigger.

You might think: “Why not just upload my entire doc DB or codebase to the chat?”

But that’s flawed for two reasons:

1. Bigger context ≠ better context
Just because the model can see more doesn’t mean it sees what matters.

2. Tokens aren’t free
If you're building anything beyond a personal project, 
cost becomes very real.

Serving millions of users with token-heavy prompts? 
That’ll burn a hole through your API budget.
You can’t afford to brute-force context.

You need to engineer it, and that’s where RAG becomes non-negotiable.
