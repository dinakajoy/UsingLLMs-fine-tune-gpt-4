ðŸ©¹ Self-healing AI pipelines save sleepless nights.

I built a data pipeline for a financial AI app that could:
- Detect missing data in real time
- Re-fetch from alternate sources
- Re-run failed inference jobs automatically

End result? 0 manual interventions in 3 months.

In AI, things *will* break. The smart move is building systems that fix themselves.
