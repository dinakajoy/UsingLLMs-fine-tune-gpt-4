⚡ Caching LLM responses isn’t just about speed — it’s about cost.

In one of my AI projects, caching reduced API spend by 68% while *improving* user experience.

Strategies that worked:
- Cache by normalized prompt (case, whitespace, synonyms handled)
- Use TTLs to refresh critical data without overwhelming the model
- Layer cache hits: memory → Redis → fallback to LLM

AI latency feels like bad UX. Cache smartly, and your infra & budget will thank you.
