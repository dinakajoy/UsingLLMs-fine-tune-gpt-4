ðŸ¤– Are you smarter than ChatGPT? A kid put me on the spotâ€¦

"Are you smarter than ChatGPT?"
That was my favourite question from a kid while demoing Pepper the Robot at the STEM4Girls camp. Children have a way of asking questions that make you stop and think, often in ways they never intended.

Even though Pepperâ€™s responses rely on large language models similar to ChatGPTâ€™s â€” and, honestly, less powerful ones â€” the robot's physical form dramatically shifts how the kids perceived its intelligence.

This was yet another reminder that the "UX" around tech â€” its packaging, interface, presentation â€” usually influences our expectations of its capabilities more than even the technology itself.
