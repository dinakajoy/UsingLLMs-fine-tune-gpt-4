ðŸ“Š When ML turns your simple project into research

When "AI" / Machine Learning technology enters the picture, even seemingly simple projects suddenly transform into research projects!

During my keynote at the Ontario Project Management Competition (OPMC) 2025 event, I explored how integrating ML into projects fundamentally changes the nature of project management. Unlike traditional software projects â€” where solutions often involve assembling known components â€” ML introduces statistical uncertainty and necessitates continual experimentation; every outcome is a moving target!

This shift places extraordinary value on highly skilled project managers who can manage uncertainty and guide teams toward success despite ambiguity.

A huge thank you to everyone at OPMC for the thought-provoking discussions, and to the organizers for inviting me to speak!
