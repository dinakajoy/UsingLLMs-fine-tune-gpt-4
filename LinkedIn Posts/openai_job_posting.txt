💼 A $300K job posting that says a lot about AI careers

I saw a job posting from OpenAI for a Content Designer - salary: $245K-$310K.

For a second, I thought, “Well, there’s our proof that AI isn’t replacing us all… yet.”

But the more I thought about it, the more it hit me - this isn’t just about whether AI will take our jobs.
It’s about what’s actually valued now. It’s no longer enough to simply be good at your craft. Your technical skill still matters, but it’s no longer the main thing. What really stands out is being able to zoom out and see the bigger picture, communicate effectively across teams (and yes, with AI too), connect the work back to product goals and long-term vision, and bring empathy and deeper understanding to messy, complex problems.
That’s true whether you’re just starting out or leading at the principal level.
And honestly, part of why I clicked this posting was curiosity because in a market where salaries are shrinking, here’s a company still offering a high base for senior and principal roles. It’s rare. And telling.
…Or maybe they just want to hire someone so they can train a model to replace them later.
