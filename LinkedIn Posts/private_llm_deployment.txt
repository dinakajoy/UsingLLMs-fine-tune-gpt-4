ðŸ”’ Running your own LLM isnâ€™t just for big companies.

Using a fine-tuned 13B model on a single A100, I built a private Q&A system for a clientâ€™s proprietary docs.

Benefits:
- Zero data leaves their infra
- Lower latency than API calls
- Full control over updates & fine-tunes

Downside? You *will* need serious MLOps and monitoring.

But for sensitive industries, self-hosting is a game-changer.
