ðŸ§© Can small models really reason better than you think?

The Hierarchical Reasoning Model â€” it's been so long since I've read and implemented an ML paper this fun!

But is all the hype really justified?

Especially given the term "reasoning" in the name, you've certainly heard a loooot of noise about them online.

As it presently stands, HRM can only solve toy problems â€” BUT they are the only models, especially in their size and complexity class, that can solve those toy problems even remotely efficiently or well.

It's a huge step forward â€” but comparing them to LLMs, for example, is like comparing apples to oranges. 

To better understand the math behind and behaviour of HRMs, I wrote my own implementations in MLX (Swift) and JAX (Python) to learn a neural Sudoku solver!
