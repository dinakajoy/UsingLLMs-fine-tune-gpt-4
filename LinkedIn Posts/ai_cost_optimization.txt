ðŸ’° Optimizing AI costs without sacrificing quality.

In a production AI system, every token has a price. I ran an experiment reducing costs on a text analytics API:
- Switched from GPT-4 to GPT-3.5 for classification
- Added pre-filtering logic to skip unnecessary queries
- Batched requests where possible

The outcome: 54% cost reduction, same quality.

AI engineering is as much about economics as it is about algorithms.
