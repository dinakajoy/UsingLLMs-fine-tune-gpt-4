ðŸ”„ Real-time AI streaming is changing the game.

Most LLM use cases are request-response, but streaming output lets you:
- Show users progress as the model generates
- Cancel early if the answer is already found
- Improve perceived speed

I recently integrated streaming into a customer support tool â€” response satisfaction jumped 32% just from perceived responsiveness.

Sometimes speed isnâ€™t about milliseconds, itâ€™s about experience.
