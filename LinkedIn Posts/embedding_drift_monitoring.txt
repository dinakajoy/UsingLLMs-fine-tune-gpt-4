ðŸ“‰ Embedding drift is real â€” and it can ruin your RAG.

Over time, as you update embeddings or fine-tune your retriever, you might notice the model "forgetting" relevant docs.

I implemented an embedding drift monitor:
- Sample queries weekly
- Compare current top-k docs to historical results
- Trigger re-indexing when similarity scores shift

Treat your vector DB like a living organism â€” monitor its health.
