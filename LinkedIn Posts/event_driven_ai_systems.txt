ðŸ“¡ AI + event-driven architecture = underrated.

Instead of polling data and running the same expensive inference repeatedly, I switched to an event-driven model:
- Kafka for event streaming
- Trigger inference only on relevant changes
- Cache and reuse past results

This reduced compute load by 42% and cut latency for critical updates.

Not all AI workloads are constant â€” react to changes, donâ€™t chase them.
